            Some might even say that uniqueness is rare because
            of how much influence each individual has on another.
            This is also true of mentorship. It has been proven to
            be one of the important ingredients for success and thus
            can do wonders for one's career.

            mentoring is the right step for them, whether the
            mentee will truly value their mentorship.
