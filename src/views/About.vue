                   Over the years we have watch both high school &amp; university
                   students closely. After running a number of surveys with them we
                   identified some of the key problems that needed to be addressed.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                    Most students lack good guidance on how to take the next step in their
                    career journey.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                    <p>
                While this problem can be addressed in a number of ways, in fact, a large
                number of organisations and give-back programmes do exactly this. We wanted
                to leverage on the powers of technology and provide a solution that is both
                scalable and easily accessible. Our mentorship platform allows volunteers to
                mentor others in a free and yet guided mentorship that ensures that both
                mentees and mentors find true value from their relationship.

                <p>
                    We also want to support organisations and companies running mentorship
                    programmes. We help them package their programmes online to stimulate
                    growth, effective measuring and continuous development and assessment.
                    This is possible through our subscription based model -  Threaded groups.

                    We have been working on this idea for over two years now, and while we
                    just launched our beta, we feel we can make an impact by allowing
                    people to make meaningful and engaging relationships that can alter
                    the course of their careers &amp; lives.
